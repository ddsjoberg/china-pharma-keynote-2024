# Analysis Results Data

## Analysis Results Data (ARD)

* Encodes statistical analysis outcomes in a machine-readable format.

* Primary objective is to streamline the processes of automation, ensuring reproducibility, promoting reusability, and enhancing traceability.

* The ARD model specified how statistical results are saved into a structured format.

* The ARD can be used to to subsequently create tables and figures.

This is where I start getting interested!

The CDISC model is not over prescriptive how these results need to look.

We'll review our general approach, which lends itself to the R language

## Analysis Results Data (ARD)

* After the initial creation of an ARD, the results can later be re-used again and again for subsequent reporting needs.

- The same results can be used again and again. 

  - Great for when we are switching context (eg CSR to a slideshow): you don't need to re-calculate and re-check those calculations

- Re-creating a figure with only 2 of the 3 treatment arms, 

- Pruning a large complex table to show only the most interesting results for a presentation (when the initial results may been prepared for regulatory purposes).
