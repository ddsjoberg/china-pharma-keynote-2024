## Analysis Results Standard (ARS)

-   Emerging standard for **prospectively** encoding statistical analysis reporting pipeline in a machine-readable format.

-   Primary objectives are to leverage analysis results metadata to drive the automation of results and support storage, access, processing, traceability and reproducibility of results.

-   Logical model that describes analysis results and associated metadata.

-   Focus on concepts, _not layout_, e.g. the summary statistics, not how the results are shown in a table.

::: {.notes}
- Overview of the meta data

  - the data sets
  
  - the exclusions (e.g. ITT population)
  
  - I know the details here are sparse, but we need to get the meat of this presentation!
  
- Overview of ARD

  - Structured object to save summary results
  
  - Can be used for simply summary statistics or complex analyses
  
  - We can also save instructions formatting the results
  
- Lastly, TLGs

  - We're all familiar with the TLGs, I presume.
  
  - The ARS fills the gap between ADaM and TLGs

- {cards} helps us easily build analysis results data sets

  - YES, THIS IS A DRAFT HEX STICKER

- after the re-factor is complete, gtsummary will help us build tables from ARDs

## Analysis Results Data (ARD)

* Encodes statistical analysis outcomes in a machine-readable format.

* Primary objective is to streamline the processes of automation, ensuring reproducibility, promoting reusability, and enhancing traceability.

* The ARD model specified how statistical results are saved into a structured format.

* The ARD can be used to to subsequently create tables and figures.

* After the initial creation of an ARD, the results can later be re-used again and again for subsequent reporting needs; for example, re-creating a figure with only two of the three treatment arms shown, or pruning a large complex table to show only the most interesting results for a presentation (when the initial results may been prepared for regulatory purposes).
